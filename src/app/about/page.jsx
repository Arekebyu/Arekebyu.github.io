                    I am a student at the University of Waterloo with an interest in applied mathematics and computer science.<br/>
                    The leftmost button, the red one, will take you to the main page. I plan on putting something interesting there eventually.<br/>
                    In the "Info" section, you will find information about me. You are currently on that page.<br/>
                    Works will eventually be implemented but right now it's just a blank page.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    That's all for now, the formatting will definitely need to be updated because it is pretty ugly right now.
